## ⚔️ Battle System

### How Battles Work

Friemon features **turn-based combat** where strategy and timing are key:

1. **Battle Setup**: Each player brings their team of characters (1-3 characters)
2. **Turn Structure**: Both players select actions simultaneously each turn
3. **Action Resolution**: Actions are executed based on character speed and technique priority
4. **Victory Conditions**: Defeat all enemy characters to win!

### Unique Combat Mechanics

#### 💙 Mana Pool System
Unlike traditional move-based systems, Friemon uses **shared mana resources**:
- **Single MP Pool**: All techniques draw from one mana reservoir per character
- **Strategic Resource Allocation**: Choose between many weak spells or few powerful ones
- **Mana Efficiency**: High-tier characters have better mana-to-damage ratios
- **Empty Pool Consequences**: Run out of mana and you're limited to basic physical attacks
- **Mana Recovery**: Some techniques and items can restore MP during battle

*Example: Frieren has 100 MP. She can cast one devastating 80 MP spell, or eight 10 MP attacks, or mix different combinations.*

#### 🎭 Character Complexity Tiers
Characters have **mechanical depth levels** that affect gameplay:

**🟤 Common Characters:**
- Simple, predictable abilities with clear effects
- Perfect for learning basic game mechanics
- Low mana costs, straightforward strategy

**🟡 Legendary Characters:**
- **Conditional Abilities**: Powers that change based on battle state
- **Resource Management**: Complex mana curves and timing windows  
- **Multi-Step Combos**: Techniques that set up future powerful moves
- **High Risk/Reward**: Devastating potential but difficult execution

*Example: A Common character might have "Deal 30 damage for 20 MP." A Legendary character might have "Deal 10-100 damage based on current mana percentage, costs all remaining MP."*

#### 🌟 Dynamic Affinity Interactions
**Multi-layered elemental system** beyond simple rock-paper-scissors:

**Cross-Element Advantages:**
- **⚡ Lightning** beats both **💧 Water** (conductivity) and **🔥 Fire** (energy disruption)
- **🌪️ Wind** provides **speed bonuses** regardless of opponent type
- **🌟 Light** and **🌑 Dark** have **mutual destruction** effects

**Affinity Stacking:**
- Characters can have **multiple affinities** for complex interactions
- **Pure affinity** characters get bonuses vs mixed-affinity opponents
- **Neutral techniques** ignore affinity entirely for consistent damage

#### ⚙️ Technique Categories & Multi-Effects
**Hybrid abilities** that blur traditional categories:

**Multi-Category Techniques:**
- **Offensive + Utility**: "Lightning Strike" - deals damage AND reduces opponent speed
- **Defensive + Healing**: "Sacred Barrier" - blocks attacks AND restores HP over time
- **Utility + Resource**: "Mana Burn" - damages opponent AND steals their MP

**Conditional Effects:**
- **State-Based**: Techniques that change power based on HP, MP, or battlefield conditions
- **Combo Enablers**: Moves that enhance or unlock other techniques
- **Persistent Effects**: Abilities that continue working for multiple turns

#### 🏔️ Ambient Magic & Terrain
**Environmental conditions** that fundamentally alter battle rules:

**Ambient Magic Examples:**
- **High Mana Field**: All techniques cost 50% less MP
- **Anti-Magic Zone**: Only physical attacks work, all spells disabled  
- **Chaos Storm**: Random technique effects each turn
- **Time Dilation**: Speed stats doubled/halved for all characters

**Terrain Effects:**
- **Lava Fields**: Fire techniques boosted, but all characters take burn damage
- **Ancient Ruins**: Defensive techniques enhanced, offensive techniques weakened
- **Mana Springs**: Characters regenerate MP each turn
- **Void Rifts**: Random techniques get reflected back at caster

#### 🎯 Hazard & Battlefield Control
**Persistent effects** that create spatial strategy:

**Hazard Placement:**
- **Poison Clouds**: Deal damage to characters in specific positions
- **Ice Walls**: Block certain techniques or provide cover
- **Mana Drains**: Continuously reduce MP in affected areas
- **Lightning Rods**: Redirect electrical attacks

**Positioning Strategy:**
- **Formation Bonuses**: Characters in certain arrangements get buffs
- **Range Mechanics**: Some techniques only work from specific positions
- **Area Control**: Control space to limit opponent options
